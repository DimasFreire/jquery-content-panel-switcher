<h1>jQuery Content Panel Switcher</h1>
<p>The jQuery Content Panel Switcher is a simple, very lightweight jQuery plugin that allows smooth transitioning of 
content in and out of panels located anywhere on the page. You can have single or multiple content switching panels 
on a single page Content panels can be either span or div elements, and the buttons used to switch the content can be 
just about anything, so long as they have the right clases assigned.
</p>
<p>
Setup is very simple, just create your content, create the panel you wish to switch the content in and out of, 
create your buttons then assign the appropriate classes and ID's. Unlike tabbed or folding style content swicthers, 
the panels and swicther buttons can be located anywhere on the page, any size or shape. There are two types of transition 
effects you can pick from, a fader and a slider.
